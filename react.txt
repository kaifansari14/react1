What is React?
-> React is a JS library used to build user interfaces, especially single-page applications(SPAs)

Why React exists?
    Traditional JS:
        - Manually update DOM
        - Messy event handling
        - Hard to scale

    React:
    - UI is broken into components
    - UI updated automatically when data changes
    - Much easier to reason about complex apps

History of React
-> Origins and invention (2011 - 2013)
    - 2011 - Created at Facebook by Jordan Walke (inspired by XHP, a PHP component framework).
    - 2012 - Used internally in Facebook's News Feed.
    - 2013 - Open-sourced at JSConf US.
        JSX (HTML in JS) was initially controversial.

-> Growth & Adoption (2014 - 2016)
    - 2014 - Used in instagram.com
    - 2015 - React Native announced (React for mobile).
    - 2016 - Create React App launched for bootstrapping React apps.

-> Modern Evolution
    - 2019 - Hooks introduced in React 16.8, revolutionizing state management in functional components.
    - Today - React powers Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Airbnb, and more.
    - It's also the core of Next.js, the most popular full-stack React framework.

React, DOM, and JS essentials
-> Understanding the DOM in React
    - Virtual DOM
        - A lightweight JS object representing the UI
        - Stored in memory as JS objects
        - Very fast to update
        - Used with React (React.createElement or JSX)
        - What is it? A virtual copy of the real DOM kept in memory

    Example:
    {
        type: 'h1',
        props: {
            children: 'Hello world'
        }
    }

|    Feature         Virtual DOM         Real DOM
================================================================
|    Speed           Fast                Slow
|    Storage         In memory           Browser
|    Updates         Smart diffing       Full re-render

Library vs Framework
-> Library - Like your toy box
    - You use only what you want
    - You control the flow
    - Examples: React, Lodash, jQuery, Axios

-> Framework - like LEGO instructions
    - Structure is defined
    - You follow the rules
    - Examples: Angular, Express, Django

What is a CDN?
    - CDN = Content Delivery Network
    - Network of global servers that deliver content faster

Benefits:
    - Faster load items
    - Reduced server load
    - Better availability

Why is React is called "React"?
    - Reacts to data changes by updating UI efficiently using Virtual DOM

Difference between React and React DOM
    - React = Core logic (components, hooks, state)
    - ReactDOM = Connects React with the actual DOM

react.development.js vs react.production.js
--------------------------------------------------------------
    File            Purpose         Minified        Warnings
--------------------------------------------------------------
    development     Dev mode        No              Yes
    production      Live mode       Yes             No
--------------------------------------------------------------

Remember:
    - React element is an object not HTML
    - React only runs inside the root element

JSX vs React.createElement
    - React.createElement is verbose
    - JSX makes code easier to write and understand
    const heading = <h1>Hello from React<</h1>

Bundlers: your shipping department
-> A bundler takes all your source assets & outputs an optimised bundle that browsers can download

Typical pipeline:
    1. Read every import/require
    2. Transpile (JSX -> JS, TS -> JS, etc)
    3. Concatenate / code-split
    4. Minify & tree-shake unused code
    5. Generate hashed filenames for long-term caching
    6. Server with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) during development

Popular options for React:
        Bundler                                     Highlights
        Webpack                     The most flexible & battle-tested. Large plugin ecosystem.
        Vite                        Next-gen, instant dev server via native ES modules, uses Rollup for production. Recommended now that create-react-app is EOL.
        Parcel                      Zero-config, smart defaults, blazing-fast builds thanks to a C++ core. Great for beginners.

Dependencies vs Dev Dependencies
        Purpose                                 Install command             Stored under
        Runtime / production code               npm install axios           dependencies
        Tooling needed only while developing    npm install -D eslint       devDependencies
                                                (alias: --save-dev)

Version ranges: ^ vs ~
^ caret         Minor and patch versions        17.0.2, 17.1.0 ... but not 18.0.0
~ tilde         Patch versions only             17.0.2, 17.0.9 ... but not 17.1.0

Use ^ for most libraries; switch to ~ when you must lock down to patch versions

                            19.2.5
                            19 is major
                            2 is minor
                            5 is patch
